Signature Verification Service

Verifies wallet ownership through EIP-191 personal_sign signatures.
Prevents users from analyzing wallets they don't own.

Security Features:
- Signature verification (ecrecover)
- Timestamp validation (prevent replay attacks)
- Message format validation
- Rate limiting ready (can add IP-based limits)
